## Documentation

### User Authentication

- **Registration (`/register`):** Allows new users to create an account by providing a username and password. User credentials (username and a hashed password) are stored in the `site.db` SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
- **Login (`/login`):** Authenticates existing users by verifying their username and password against the data in `site.db`. Upon successful login, the user's ID is stored in a session.

### Quests System

- **Quest Data:** Quest definitions (name, description, rewards) are loaded from the `quests.xlsx` file using the pandas library.
- **New Quests (`/new_quests`):** Fetches a random selection of quests from the Excel file and renders them in `new_quests_partial.html`.
- **Accepting Quests (`/accept_quest/<quest_id>`):** When a user clicks "Accept," the `quest_id` is added to the `active_quests` list within the user's data in `user_data.json`.
- **Active Quests (`/quests_data`):** Retrieves the user's active quest IDs from `user_data.json`, fetches the corresponding quest details from `quests.xlsx`, and renders them in `quests_list_partial.html`.
- **Completing Quests (`/complete_quest/<quest_id>`):** When a user clicks "Completed":
    - The rewards (gold and XP) from the completed quest are added to the user's data in `user_data.json`.
    - The `quest_id` is moved from the `active_quests` list to the `completed_quests` list in `user_data.json`.
    - The completed quest details are saved to `completed_quests.json`.
    - The user's level is checked and potentially increased based on accumulated XP.
- **Deleting Quests (`/delete_quest/<quest_id>`):** When a user clicks "X," the `quest_id` is removed from the `active_quests` list in `user_data.json`.

### Profile Management

- **Profile Display (`/profile`):** Fetches the user's data from `user_data.json` and displays their username, level, experience, and currency.
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):** The main user interface displaying a summary of the user's profile and navigation buttons.

### Leveling System

- Experience points (XP) are awarded upon completing quests.
- A base experience threshold is defined for leveling up (currently 100 XP for level 2).
- The experience required for each subsequent level increases by 5%.
- The `complete_quest` route checks for level-ups after awarding XP and updates the user's level in `user_data.json`.

### Data Storage

- **`user_data.json`:** Stores dynamic user-specific information, including level, experience, currency, and lists of active and completed quest IDs.
- **`quests.xlsx`:** Contains the static definitions for all available quests in the game.
- **`site.db`:** An SQLite database used by Flask-SQLAlchemy to store user authentication details (usernames and hashed passwords).
- **`completed_quests.json`:** Stores a history of all quests completed by users, including the user ID and the quest details.

### Frontend Interaction

- **`dashboard.html`:** The main layout with buttons to navigate to different sections.
- **JavaScript (`static/dashboard.js`):** Handles dynamic fetching of content for different sections (profile, quests) and interacts with the backend to accept and complete/delete quests without full page reloads.
- **HTML Partials (`templates/*.html`):** Smaller HTML snippets loaded into the `content-area` of `dashboard.html` to display specific data (e.g., profile information, lists of quests).

## Future Enhancements

- **Bingo Feature:** Implement a bingo board with self-improvement tasks.
- **To-Do List:** Allow users to create and manage their own custom tasks.
- **More Complex Quest Types:** Introduce quests with different requirements and mechanics.
- **Skill System:** Implement skills that can be improved with experience and affect gameplay.
- **Inventory System:** Allow users to acquire and manage virtual items.
- **User Interface Improvements:** Enhance the visual design and user experience.
- **Database Migration:** Transition from JSON and Excel to a more robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- **More Sophisticated Leveling Curve:** Implement a more nuanced experience point progression.
